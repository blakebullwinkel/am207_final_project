This repository contains a TensorFlow implementation of the model for transfer learning proposed in *Fast Adaptation with Linearized Neural Networks* by Maddox et al. (2021), along with experiments using synthetic and real-world data that highlight scenarios in which the proposed method fails to outperform the predictive performance of GPs with generic RBF kernels.
